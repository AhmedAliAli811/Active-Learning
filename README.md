# Comparison between Passive and Active Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and report for a comparison between passive and active machine learning techniques using uncertainty sampling, margin, and query by committee. The project involves the analysis of two datasets: Loan and Diabetes.

## Files

- **data/**: Contains the datasets used in the project:
  - `Loan.csv`: Dataset for loan prediction.
  - `Diabetes.csv`: Dataset for diabetes prediction.

- **code/**: Contains the code used for the analysis. To access the code, open the Kaggle Notebook and import the code file.

- **report/**: Contains the report detailing the comparison between passive and active machine learning techniques.

## Instructions for Accessing the Code

To access the code:
1. Open the Kaggle Notebook platform.
2. Import the code file located in the `code/` directory.

## Project Overview

In this project, we conducted a comparative analysis between passive and active machine learning methodologies. We explored various techniques such as uncertainty sampling, margin, and query by committee to understand their effectiveness in different scenarios. The report provides detailed insights into the experimentation process, results, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
